# SNHU-CS300


What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
- The problems that we solbed in these course projects involved analyzing the complexity of algorithms involved in the use of various data structures. We cross-compared the benefits and drawbacks to each type and made selections based on performance and real-world constraints.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
- I attempted to find the balance between memory and runtime as well as an understanding of the use case to select the best ADT and algorightms.
- Data structures are important to understand because they change the architecture of your solution significantly. The algorightms used in the data structures can also have a great impact on the runtime and complexity of solution as the input size reaches n.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
- I had to google quite a bit, and also found free MIT course materials that went much deeper and explained many things that this course did not.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
- I have a greater respect for the people who design and implement software algorithms and code in general. Knowing that there are such massive considerations to be made from a mathematical and theory perspective before one codes has really changed my view of how much work efficient code requires.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- Though I feel I need to understand some of the TDD methods more fully, I believe that this course has further reinforced concepts related to proper software development such as psuedocode, commenting, and common conventions.
